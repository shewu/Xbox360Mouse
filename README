Simple Daemon that lets you use your Xbox 360 controller as a Mouse. Perfect for bed computers and home theater setups. I wrote it so I could use my iMac G4 sitting on my nightstand without a keyboard or a mouse (I need a chatpad for the controller for the keyboard part to work). The daemon uses very little memory and requires the Xbox 360 Mac driver to work.

Much of the project is based off Colin Munro's work:
